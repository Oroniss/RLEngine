How to sort them out - seems like an obvious use for delegates.
How to make sure they all have the same signature.

- Test should be straight forward, actor, current_level, don't really need anything else.
- How to make sure the action can happen though - 2 types - movement and ability/attack?
- Could have a list of "Entities" as targets - that means a target selection needs to be in there too though.
- Keep movement separate - use if no "Action" possible or on other conditions - this seems like it should
go on the ability class now though instead...
- What about movement abilities?


Add game event tests.
Add quest and achievement tests.
